She feels as though you're judging her for feeling this way, and she does not feel comfortable to continue the conversation. You and Sam share some small chit-chat for the next few days, but you don't hear from Sam after that. You failed to help Sam. Next time, you should offer your support and ask her to open up about how she feels without belittling her. Game over."

It was also good that you asked her about her suicidal comment, as this is something you should always take seriously. You and/or Sam should contact her general practioner and inform them that she is having suicidal thoughts."

Also, great job encouraging her in a kind and gentle manner! Using kind, non-threatening vocabulary is key to fostering a safe environment for Sam to open up to you. By giving Sam gentle encouragement and suggesting ways of destressing like taking breaks or working with a friend, this helps Sam help herself."

Your chats with her are starting to cause you emotional strain, so you shouldn't ignore your own feelings just because you want to help your friend. It is important to establish emotional boundaries with a depressed friend so you can help them while also helping yourself."

There is a difference between establishing boundaries while providing support and simply driving the depressed person away. In this case, you did the latter. You failed to help Sam. She no longer feels comfortable talking to you about her problems. Game over. "
